Self-tutorial for understanding clustering. 
K-means is not able to create the clusters because two points belong to same cluster if they are closer in terms of eucledian distance. 
But vectors in latest space are not necessarily closer to each other if they belong to same digit. Why?
Because encoder is not trained in such a way that latent vectors will be closer.
